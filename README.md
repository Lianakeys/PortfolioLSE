<!-- Description of portfolio website -->
PURPOSE

-->The purpose of my website is to function as a resume to allow employers, recruiting companies and other web designers to observe my web developing skills, and as a mean to improve my html and css skills. It also serves as a platform to allow other people to view my works, to contact me via email, and have access to my public information (such as facebook, linkedin, github and twitter). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURES

-->Some of the functionality and features that are included in my website :
1. Responsive design : I've managed to create a website that makes use of flexible layouts and images by controlling the elements in my website by applying media queries into my css files. In addition, by using fluid, proportion-based grids such as using percentage instead of pixels. Ultimately, my goal of implementing a responsive design is to build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size and will be able to adjust and orientate the size,layout and colors of the page accordingly. (eg, will be able to view my website using phones, tablets, etc)

2. Affordable to improve : My website has room for improvement for example, the layout and the functionality could be altered. By making some changes, for example adding different elements(icons, widgets, cards, buttons, animations etc) allows me to amend the functionality of my website to attract more audience. Later on when combining with javascript, I will be able to improve the whole layout of my website, to make it more accessible, unique and presentable.

3. Layout consistency : I've created a website that has a consistent use of colors and icons. Layout is also similar in all web pages by following a certain layout in order to sustain one theme as well as giving a sense of uniformity, to be able to display my website clearly. For example, consistent use of logos, and page-number icon, which indicates which page the user is in, as well as correct use of icons that is clear and understandable, in order to direct users to the page accordingly. Consistent use of fonts, colors, design structure and sizes of elements, position of interactive elements will create a site that appears to be more appealing, clean and presentable, and also to avoid looking untidy and disorganized. 

4. Contact Form : I've also added a contact web page wthat allows a user/visitor to enter their basic data(such as name, email, message) which is sent to a server for processing. Users/Visitors are allowed to fill out a 'contact me' form by typing in their details in a clear, concise, and pre-designated text fields. By using the method of submitting the data, GET/POST, allows users/visitors to send their data into a platform "formspree" and will alert my email once sent.

5. Social media integration : I've also added some links to my social media profiles such as Facebook, linkedin, twitter, github at my 'contact me' page. This allows a clear indication of where to contact me under one platform which is key to visibility, advertising and growth. I've added some custom social  media icons that I've obtained from font-awesome and then adding links to the icons accordingly.

6. Allow easy access to other pages in my website : I've added some features in each of the pages to allow better accessibility when exploring my website. For example, hoverdropdowns on each web page so that visitors can access to other pages in my website without having to go back to the main page. Clear and direct buttons, design, and colours to navigate the visitors on where to press and what page they are currently at.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TARGET AUDIENCE
1. Other  web designers. To apply my html and css skills and display it all on my portfolio website and share it with different people. I might be able to obtain some comments and advice on my design and development in order to improve myself, and to expand my network by getting in touch with other web designers.   

2. Anyone. This allows other people to share my work online. People who like my design can share their same interest with me.

3. Employers/ Recruiters. My website also serves as a resume, and a good platform to show off my skills, to increase my profile visibility, my connections, career and nerworking opportunities. 

4. Myself. To be able to put my html and css skills to use, be able to optimize my favorite browser. To create different projects, and to improve my skills,  and display it online.

TECH STACK

Html 
-->
- Used VScode
- Created 4 html pages 
- Home page : Link to all other pages
- Bio page : Description of myself (what I am currently doing...etc)
- Skills page : List of my soft skills (Ruby...etc)
- Contact page : Created a page for visitors to contact me eg(form)

Css
-->
- Used VScode
- Created 11 css pages
- all linked to the main page (portfolio.html)
- style each page separately

Deployment platform
--> My deployment platform is on github pages. There seems to be an error on deploying my portfolio to netlify (page not found/link to url is broken) and I've done quite a bit of a research on it, as well as asking help from tutors but, it's still not working. So I had to upload it to github pages.
On GitHub, I had to navigate to my GitHub Pages site's repository in settings (under my repository name). Then, select master as my GitHub Pages publishing source. (Basically got help from A-A-ron)

USABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Accessibility : Easy and simple design concept allowing users/visitors to easily understand, navigate, and interact with the website. This includes adding similar features in the website, and a consistent use of icons, logo, menu bar etc. For example, hoverdropdowns on each web page so that visitors can access to other pages in my website without having to go back to the main page. Clear and direct buttons, design, and colours to navigate the visitors on where to press and what page they are currently at. 

Responsive design : I've managed to create a website that makes use of flexible layouts and images by controlling the elements in my website by applying media queries into my css files. In addition, by using fluid, proportion-based grids such as using percentage instead of pixels. Ultimately, my goal of implementing a responsive design is to build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size and will be able to adjust and orientate the size,layout and colors of the page accordingly. (eg, will be able to view my website using phones, tablets, etc). 


Layout and Navigation : Designed a layout that is presentable in terms of information and choices in a clear and concise way, a lack of ambiguity and the placement of important items in appropriate areas. Eg, (able to direct visitors/users where are the navigation bars, page indication). I have also designed a consistent layout (structure of design) to sustain only one theme as well as giving a sense of uniformity, to be able to display my website clearly. I've also added a hoverdropdown menu on each page to enable easy access to other pages hence implementing the usability considerations.

Social Media Integration :  I've also added some links to my social media profiles such as Facebook, linkedin, twitter, github at my 'contact me' page. This allows a clear indication of where to contact me under one platform which is key to visibility, advertising and growth. I've added some custom social  media icons that I've obtained from font-awesome and then adding links to the icons accordingly.

Errors & Effectiveness: Numerous try and error by constantly changing the code (html and css) to view and alter any errors users encounter when using the website, the possibilities of choices they make in pursuit of the links included in the website, and can users use the functionality in the website (eg forms), check for broken links, etc.

Contact Form : I've also added a contact web page wthat allows a user/visitor to enter their basic data(such as name, email, message) which is sent to a server for processing. Users/Visitors are allowed to fill out a 'contact me' form by typing in their details in a clear, concise, and pre-designated text fields. By using the method of submitting the data, GET/POST, allows users/visitors to send their data into a platform "formspree" and will alert my email once sent.
