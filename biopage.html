                            <h6>A web developer</h6>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            <p>I love adventures, challenges, exploring new things, but at the same time I'm also a calm, passionate and loving person. </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            
                            <p>I was born in Malaysia, a country with cultural diversity and tasty food.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I enjoy meeting new people from different cultures, thus I felt that living and working abroad undoubtfully allows me to develop and gain new perspectives in life, as well as being more independent in my work.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I've been studying a degree in Molecular Genetics at The University of Melbourne for the past few years and after completing my degree, I am currently undertaking the Coder Academy Bootcamp at the Academy of Information Technology.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p> Most of the people that I've encountered were always curious of why I've changed my career path towards IT, which is a very different area than genetics.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>  However, I've never felt that way at all. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I'm a curious person and I believe that as long as I still have room for improvement, I will strive and improve myself. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>  I believe that, with my biotech skills, together with IT, I will be able to develop and improve current technologies to solve global issues.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>My motto in life is "Do what you love, Love what you do."</p>
                            <br>
